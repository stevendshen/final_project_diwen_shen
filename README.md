##### CPLN 692 Final Project - DIWEN SHEN

This project is a continuation of my midterm project exploring SEPTA bus frequencies and creating a web-based application to visualize bus service. The gap I am trying to fill is that, for time-sensitive persons (everyone!), only frequent bus service is useful. There are currently no good ways for a typical person to understand the availability of frequent bus service around the city.

This project has 2 parts:

- Scraping and cleaning frequency data for all bus routes and all hours of day from SEPTA's website using the Beautiful Soup 4 API to read html files.

- Visualizing bus service by frequency using Carto, based on some user specified criteria.

Please see JavaScript and Python code comments for more detailed descriptions of the process. Thank you!
